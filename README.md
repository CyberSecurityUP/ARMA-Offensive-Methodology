# ðŸ›¡ A.R.M.A. - Adversarial Risk Mapping & Assessment

**A.R.M.A.** is a methodology designed to elevate traditional penetration testing by combining adversarial thinking, risk chain mapping, and real business impact assessment.

Instead of following just a technical checklist, A.R.M.A. forces the tester to:
- Think like an attacker;
- Chain attacks (Risk Chain Mapping);
- Measure the real impact on the business and compliance (PCI DSS, LGPD, DORA, NIST);
- Deliver executive reports with both **qualitative and quantitative analysis**.

## ðŸ”Ž Core Principles
- **Adversarial Mindset:** "What would an attacker do next?"
- **Risk-Driven Execution:** Vulnerabilities are assessed based on the business impact.
- **Pivoting & Chaining:** Every step may open new attack paths.
- **Compliance Mapping:** Directly connects findings with regulations.
- **Continuous Learning:** Each pentest cycle improves the attacker's skills and the company's defense.
